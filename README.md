# Image Captioning

This repository holds all the files for my CS 474 final project at BYU.
It will eventually implement a state-of-the-art image captioning network to take images from the Flickr8k dataset and caption them.
Also included is my timesheet and nix build files.

## First Attempt

My first attempt was a simple encoder/decoder system I cobbled together from a few different notebooks on Kaggle, as well as my own expertise on Deep Learning.
While it was functional, it performed poorly in early tests and I didn't want to spend the training time to get a fully realized model.

## Second Attempt

My second attempt was implementing and attention-based system to improve results.
I based my work on the excellent tutorial by sgrvinod found [here](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning).
